Week2: Unix environment

1. Original UNIX was a commercial operating systems, whic is special program that supervises all programm
running on a computer.
- prevent programs from accessing each other 's memory
- prevent programs from accesssing files that belong to other users
- guard access to hard drives, keybroads, mice, printers, displays, and network interfaces.
- kill programs that endager stability by using too much memory
- provides an abstraction layer that hides the complecity of the underlying hardware.

# drag each unix command to the corresponding definition
cut : output columns from a tabular text file
echo : writen given arguments as text to standard output stream
wc : count words and lines
cat: concaternates files
top: shows the total workload and processess running on the server
chgrp: changes group of files and folders
grep: is used to search for text from give file.

# Floating point numbers are used to reprensent numbers with decimal part.
In floating point representation, exponent makes it possible to represent very large and very small numbers.
Single precision floating point numbers are represented with 32 bits.
Double precision floating point numbers are represented with 64 bits.

# In computer memery, text is stored as a contiguous sequence of character.
ASCII encodes 128 specified character into seven bit integers.
Unicode standard defines a universal character set with huge amount of character symbols, most commonly 
encoded with UTF-8 encoding.

2. Make the screen.
To see the importance of knowing how to use such a tool, imagine a case where you are not using screen, and 
your program/script has been running for several hourse. For some reason, you lose your connection to the 
remote server. This terminates the sessions and consequently, the program/script that was running. In such 
case, there is a good chance that you need to run to programm from scratch, which means that you have lost 
hours of your time.

# access rights in UNIX
connect to BINF server and run ls -l/home/|grep <your_username> in your terminal. This sequence of commands 
first lists the contents of /home/directory and then selects only line containing <your_names> with grep command.

3. Using FastQC and trimmomatic tools for high-throughput sequence quality control. 
fastqc <file name> <folder name>
In here, I have two samples sample_r1.fastqc and sample_2.fastqc
Command:
fastqc sample_r1.fastqc <directory storing the output>
fastqc sample_r2.fastqc <directory storing the output>
The output includes two files: HTML and ZIP file. HIML file can be open in the web brower on the local machine.
It shows the quality of sample and statistical analysis of sample. 

4. MultiQC tool 
FastQC tool create one HTML file per each FASTQ file. WHat if you had tens or more samples of FASTQ files (
or other file such as SAM and BAM), a case that happens often in bioinformatics project, and you wanted to perform
the QC on those samples? In that case, it would be rather difficult and time consuming to inspect the QC results one 
file at a time. Thanks to a toold callsed MultiQC, one can aggrefate results from bioinformatics analyses across many 
samples into one single report.
Command:
multiQC <file names> <directory>

5. Trimmomatic tool
I inspected the quality of two FASTQ files using FastQC. There, everything looked quite OK. But this is not always 
the case. For instance, in Illumina sequencing technology, when performing sequencing experiments, the more cycles do,
the more base call quality scores drop (drop in the quality scores means that there is a higher chance that the 
sequencer machine might have made a mistake in calling A, C, G, and T based. 

For example, if you look at the MultiQC results under Sequence Quality Histograms, you can see a slight drop in the 
quality scores after position 94. In this specific example, the quality scores after position 94 are in the yellow 
zone (i.e. the Phred quality score falls below 28) which would, in most cases, still be good enough not to necessitate 
any further action. However, in case they were in the red zone, one solution would be to remove/trim part of the reads 
with low quality scores. In this exercise, we use a tool called trimmomatic to achieve this.

Command: to cut off the sequence after location 94
trimmomatic PE ../../sample_r1.fastq ../../sample_r2.fastq -baseout ./Trim_Reads CROP:94
