Week3: bowtie2 command, samtools view

1. bowtie2 command is used to create the index file that is made from a reference genome. To create an index file for a give reference genome
Command:
bowtie2-build hg38_chr7.fa hg38_chr7_index

Assume that we have paired-end reads, what are the meaning of -x, -1, -2, and -S command line options in the bowtie2 command:
	-x specifies the bowtie2 index file
	-1 specifies the files that contains the #1 mates, paired with file in <m2>
	-2 specifies the file that contains the #2 mates, paired with file in <m1>
	-S specifies the name of the output SAM file for writing the results into. Otherwies, be default, the results are written in stdout
	-q command-line option to tell the input data are in FASTQ format
	-f command-line options to tell the input data are in FASTA format
The parameter values for sensitive present are -D 15 -R 2 -N 0 -L 22 -i S,1,1.5
It means: -R for reads with repetitive seeds, try 2 sets of seeds- -D give up extending after 15 failed extend in a row. -N maximum number of 
mismatches in seed alignments is 0. -L length of seed sub-string is 22. 
The command will be fast present give up extending failed extend earlier than sensitive preset.
Command:
bowtie2 -x hg38_chr7_index -1 FL7_r1.fastq.gz FL2_r2.fastq.gz -S FL7.sam 2>bowtie2_stats.log

Role of log file: if the command ends immediately afer execution and you are redirecting the stderr to a log file, inspect the log file and look 
possible errors.

If we want to change and save the result directly in BAM file, we can do sequece of commands:
bowtie2 --verr-fast -x hg38_chr7_index -1 /PATH/TO/FL_1.fastq.gz -2/PATH/TO/FL7_r2.fastq.gz 2>bowtie2_stats.log | samtools view -O BAM -o/PATH/TO/FL7.bam

Key paprameters affecting alignment performance include:
	- seed length
	- interval between consecutive seeds
	- number of mismatches allowed per seed
	- how many consecutive seed extensions can fail before stopping
	- how many times is a read re-seeded (by changing offset) in case there are too many seed hits
Bowtie2 is not suitable when we want to aling data that has longer gaps in the alignments such as RNA-seq data. 

2. Samtools view command
Convert the FL7.sam file to BAM file with the name FL7.bam. This command is used to align the data in bam file
Command:
samtoos view -o FL7.bam -O BAM FL7.sam

3. Samtools sort command
After alignment, the order of the aligned reads in the BAM file follows the order of the reads in the FASTQ file. Some bioinformatics tools require that 
BAM files to be sorted to be able to do their job. Thus, here, we will sort the BAM file by genomic position such as chromosomal coordinate using samtools
sort command.
Command:
samtools sort FL7.bam -o FL7_sorted. bam

Note that, again,we ended up with two BAM files containing the same information where only different between them is that one is sorted and the other not.
It is possible to create a sequence of commands, that does the alignment, BAM conversion and sorting and by that fix the issue of having intermediary SAM/BAM files.
Command:
bowtie2 --very-fast -x hg38_chr7_index -1 /PATH/TO/FL7_r1.fastq.gz -2/PATH/TO/FL7_r2.fastq.gz 2>bowtie2_stats.log |samtools view -O BAM | samtools sort -o FL7_sorted.bam

4. The output of the samtools stats is quite detailed. Run the following command to visualuz the results:
Command:
plot-bamstats-p FL7_stats_viz /log_file.log

Replace the log_file.log with the log file you created for the samtools stats command. This command creats a new directly containing an index-html file. Open the index.html file 
in your web browser and inspect the results. One of the figures reports the GC content. What is the GC content percentage at the peak of the curve?
